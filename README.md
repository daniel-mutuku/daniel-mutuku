## Backend Systems Engineering (Go)

I’m a professional software engineer with 7+ years of experience building
production systems for real businesses.

This GitHub documents a deliberate shift from application-level backend work
into backend systems engineering, with a focus on understanding how systems
behave under load, partial failure, and scale.

Primary areas of focus:
- Distributed systems & microservices
- Event-driven and messaging-based architectures
- Data-intensive applications
- Concurrency and parallel processing
- System reliability, observability, and failure handling
- Backend performance and security fundamentals

Primary languages:
- Go
- Node.js

### How to Read This GitHub

This is not a collection of CRUD applications.

Most repositories here are focused experiments or system-level prototypes.
Each repo typically includes:
- A clear problem statement
- Design notes or tradeoffs
- Experiments or benchmarks
- Observations about failure modes
